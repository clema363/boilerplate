- shadcn-vue with Tailwind CSS
- Authentication with Better Auth
- Subscriptions and once-off payments with Stripe
- Email sending with vue-email and MailChannels
- Documentation with Nuxt Content
- A D1 / sqlite database queried with Drizzle ORM

- Instant deployment with Cloudflare and NuxtHub
- A settings page that starts with profile management, security and billing
- Forgot password flow built in
- Quickly configurable via the `app.config.ts` to get up and running in a few minutes

## Paradigm

This starter was mostly built as a personal project at [Kaizen Media](https://www.kaizen.com.na). The idea is to have a clean slate project where you can just run `pnpm install` update some .env vars, some config things and have a SaaS site set up and ready to go.
