# Installation

Blanq is a starter kit, you can clone it from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Eckhardt-D/blanq).

For example, clone it into a new project named `my-project`:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Eckhardt-D/blanq my-project
```

Remember to update some things that cannot be parameterized in the `app.config.ts` file, like the `name` and `description` in the `package.json` file.
Some other things you might want to update:

### Change the remote to your own repository

```bash
git remote set-url origin <your-repo-url>
```

Or start completely fresh in git:

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
```
