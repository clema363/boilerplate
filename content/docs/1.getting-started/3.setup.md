# Setting up Blanq

Each section of these docs will guide you through specific setup steps. To get started, here is what you need to do:

### Populate your environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:
You can copy the example `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Here is a rundown of the variables, explaining what they are used for:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|   ---    |     ---     |   ---   |
| NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL | The URL of your site, this is used in checkout and other places that need full URLs for redirects etc. | http://localhost:3000 |
| NUXT_MAIL_CHANNELS_BASE_URL | The base URL of the MailChannels API, please see the [Emails](/docs/emails) section for more info on Local Email flow | http://localhost:8008 |
| NUXT_MAIL_CHANNELS_API_KEY | The API key for MailChannels, not needed if using development setup | |
| NUXT_MAIL_SENDER_EMAIL | The email address that will be used to send emails | |
| NUXT_MAIL_SENDER_NAME | The name that will be used to send emails | |
| NUXT_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | The secret key for your Stripe account | |
| NUXT_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET | The webhook secret for your Stripe account | |
| BETTER_AUTH_SECRET | The secret key for BetterAuth | |
| BETTER_AUTH_URL | The URL of the BetterAuth server, similar to site url but this env var is read explicitly from [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com) | http://localhost:3000 |

### Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### Start the local mail server

Please see [This Repo](https://github.com/Eckhardt-D/mailchannels-dev) for more information on how to start a local mailbox and sender.
Alternatively, you could always use your real MailChannels account API key and URL in the `.env` file.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8008:8008 mailchannels-dev # After Building The Image
```

### Start the development server

Now you are ready to start developing your app. You can run the development server with:

```bash
bun dev
```
