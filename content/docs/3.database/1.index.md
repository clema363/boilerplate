# Database

Blanq is designed to be used with NuxtHub and Cloudflare. The database is a Cloudflare D1 database and locally it uses sqlite. The database is queried and managed with [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team).

## Schemas

The database schemas live in `server/database/schemas`. They are then exported in `server/database/schema.ts` and used in the `server/utils/drizzle.ts` file.
When defining a new table, remember to export it.

### Making database changes

The flow to make changes in the database is as follows:

1. Make a change to a schema file (or add a new one)
2. Run `pnpm db:generate` to generate the SQL migration file
3. Run `pnpm dev` to apply the migration

Migrations are applied automatically when the server starts and when it is built in production on NuxtHub.

## Drizzle helpers

You can use the Drizzle instance in any event handler as follows and it is automatically imported:

```typescript
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
    const db = useDrizzle()

    // e.g.
    const user = await db.select().from(tables.users).where(eq(tables.users.email, 'some@email.com')).limit(1)
})
```

Some of the drizzle filters are exported for convenience in the `server/utils/drizzle.ts` file.

```typescript
export { and, asc, desc, eq, not, or, sql } from 'drizzle-orm'
export const tables = schema
```

The `tables` object is also automatically imported into your event handlers.
