# Sending emails

Blanq uses [vue-email](https://vuemail.net) to send emails. The platform used for delivery in production is [MailChannels](https://mailchannels.com).
With MailChannels' free tier for developers you can send up to 3000 emails per month or 100 per day. To save on resources in development there is a helpful [Docker Image](https://github.com/Eckhardt-D/mailchannels-dev) that you can use to test your email sending.

## Setting up the development environment

Clone the [mailchannels-dev](https://github.com/Eckhardt-D/mailchannels-dev) repository.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Eckhardt-D/mailchannels-dev
```

Then run the following commands:

```bash
cd mailchannels-dev && docker build -t mailchannels-dev .
```

Start the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8008:8008 mailchannels-dev
```

You can now access the MailChannels dashboard at [http://localhost:8008](http://localhost:8008). This is where all the emails you send will appear in development.
Just be sure to set your .env file correctly:

```bash
NUXT_MAIL_CHANNELS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8008
NUXT_MAIL_CHANNELS_API_KEY=
```

The docker container API matches the `send` endpoint of MailChannels.

## Creating an email template

Blanq uses [Vue Email](https://vuemail.net) to send emails. The email templates are stored in the `server/emails` folder. The email templates are written in Vue and can be styled with Tailwind CSS.

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { Button, Text } from '@vue-email/components'
import Base from './base.vue'

defineProps<{
  confirmationLink: string
}>()
</script>

<template>
  <Base header-text="Please click the button below to confirm your account" title="Verify Your Account">
    <Text>If you did not sign up for an account, please ignore this email.</Text>

    <Button :href="confirmationLink" class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold p-3 rounded">
      Verify Account
    </Button>
  </Base>
</template>
```

You likely want to use the 'Base' component, and can adjust it to your needs. Find it at `server/emails/base.vue`.

## Sending an email

There is a `useEmail` utils that can be used anywhere in the server to send an email. Here is an example of how to send an email:

```typescript
const emails = useEmails(useRuntimeConfig(event))

await emails.sendEmailChangeEmail({
  newEmail,
  resetUrl: url,
  to: {
    name: user.name,
    email: user.email,
  },
})
```

The email util requires the runtimeConfig to read the from email and name and in production the MailChannels API key.

## Sending emails in Better Auth's handlers

The flow is a little different in Better Auth's handlers. Since there is no 'event' we cannot reliably get the runtimeConfig to pass to the Email util.

To get around this, there is a special class in utils called `EnhancedRequest`. This class is a wrapper around the request object that is passed to Better Auth:

`server/api/auth/[...all].ts`

```typescript
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const config = useRuntimeConfig(event)
  const enhancedRequest = new EnhancedRequest(toWebRequest(event))
  enhancedRequest.__config = config
  return serverAuth().handler(enhancedRequest)
})
```

This makes it possible to get the runtime config in the Better Auth handlers:

```typescript
function createAuth() {
  return betterAuth({
      ...
      changeEmail: {
        enabled: true,
        sendChangeEmailVerification: async ({ user, newEmail, url }, request) => {
          if (request === undefined) {
            throw new Error('Request is undefined, cannot send email')
          }

          // This is the request as it is passed from `api/[...auth].ts` which is where
          // it is 'enhanced' with the runtimeConfig. Not a perfect solution.
          const enhanced: EnhancedRequest = request
          const emails = useEmails(enhanced.__config!)

          await emails.sendEmailChangeEmail({
            newEmail,
            resetUrl: url,
            to: {
              name: user.name,
              email: user.email,
            },
          })
        },
      },
    },
...
```

Though this is not ideal, for now it's a simple way to access the runtimeConfig in the Better Auth handlers.
