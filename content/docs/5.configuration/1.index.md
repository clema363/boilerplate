# Configuring a new project

Blanq uses Nuxt's `app.config.ts` file to hard-code information so that it is easily updatable for new projects.

The basic structure of this file is:

```typescript
type config = {
 appName: string,
  seo: {
    home: {
      title: string
      description: string,
    },
  },
  copy: {
    authPageTestimonial: string,
    landing: {
      heading: string,
      subHeading: string,
    },
  },
  navigation: {
    landing: [
      { title: string, to: string },
    ],
  },
  subscriptionBadgeText: string,
  products: [
    {
      type: 'subscription' | 'payment',
      priceId: undefined,
      title: string,
      price: number,
      description: string,
      features: string[],
      action: string,
    },
  ],
  features: [
    {
      title: string,
      icon: string,
      description: string,
    },
  ],
}
```

With this configuration you can easily update some of the boilerplate on the landing page, configure products and features and navigation.
