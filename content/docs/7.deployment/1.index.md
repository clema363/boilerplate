# Deploying Blanq

Blanq is meant to be hosted with [NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com). You can deploy your Blanq app directly via the NuxtHub CLI or via GitHub.

## Deploying via NuxtHub CLI

To deploy via the CLI. First ensure that you have and account at [NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com) and have your Cloudflare account connected to NuxtHub.

Then try a test build:

```bash
npx nuxt build
```

If your application does not build and throws an error regarding Out Of Memory (currently a rollup issue while building the Nitro server), try again with:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192 npx nuxt build
```

(on Windows):

```bash
set NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192 && npx nuxt build
```

Once your build is successful, you can do a real deploy to NuxtHub:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192 npx nuxthub deploy
```

## Deploying via GitHub

To deploy via GitHub, you need to have a GitHub account and a repository for your project. You can create a new repository on GitHub and push your project to it.
Once you have your project on GitHub, you can connect your repository to NuxtHub and deploy your project via the NuxtHub admin interface.

If your builds are failing due to Out Of Memory issues, you can try the following:

Go to the `.github/workflows/nuxthub.yml` file and add the following line to the `build` step:

```yaml
      - name: Build application
        run: NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 pnpm build
```
